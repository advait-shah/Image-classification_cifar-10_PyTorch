# Image-classification_cifar-10_PyTorch
Classification of cifar-10 Images using CNN in Python- PyTorch Framework
Implemented CNN with different architectures and made following comparisons to improve classification accuracy:
- CNN vs MLP
- Dropout regularization performance test
- ReLU and Sigmoid activations based models
- SGD_RMSprop_Adam_AdaGrad_optimizers_evaluation
- VGGNet concept: filter_size_vs_network depth
- tanh and Sigmoid models_space represention comparison
